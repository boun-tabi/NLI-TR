# üìú NLI-TR
The Natural Language Inference in Turkish (NLI-TR) is a set of two large scale datasets that were obtained by translating the foundational NLI corpora ([SNLI](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/ "The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus") and [MultiNLI](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/multinli/ "The Multi-Genre NLI Corpus")) using [Amazon Translate](https://aws.amazon.com/tr/translate/ "Amazon Translate NMT service").  The English sentences of the datasets can be accessed from the original corpus by using their common identifier key (pairID).

The characteristics of the datasets can be reviewed in [the arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14963) and the details of the NLI task can be reviewed in [the lectures videos of CS224U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_VPUF9ResU&list=PLoROMvodv4rObpMCir6rNNUlFAn56Js20&index=8 "Lectures ‚Äì NLI | Stanford CS224U: Natural Language Understanding | Spring 2019").

The [SNLI-TR 1.0](https://tabilab.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/datasets/nli_datasets/snli_tr_1.0.zip "The Turkish Translation of The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus") and [SNLI-TR 1.1](https://tabilab.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/datasets/nli_datasets/snli_tr_1.1.zip "The Turkish Translation of The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus") (~44MB, zip) are the Turkish translation (NMT) of the original [SNLI 1.0](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/snli_1.0.zip "The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus") (~100MB, zip).  The only difference between the version 1.0 and 1.1 is that the latter includes and additional key field (`translation_annotations`) containing the evaluations of translations for some of the examples.

An example from SNLI:
<pre>
{
        "annotator_labels": [
            "neutral"
        ],
        "captionID": "4688994030.jpg#3",
        "gold_label": "neutral",
        "pairID": "4688994030.jpg#3r1n",
        "sentence1": "A medical worker wearing a mask in the hospital.",
        "sentence1_binary_parse": "( ( ( A ( medical worker ) ) ( wearing ( ( a mask ) ( in ( the hospital ) ) ) ) ) . )",
