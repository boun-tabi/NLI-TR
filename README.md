# üìú NLI-TR
The Natural Language Inference in Turkish (NLI-TR) is a set of two large scale datasets that were obtained by translating the foundational NLI corpora ([SNLI](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/ "The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus") and [MultiNLI](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/multinli/ "The Multi-Genre NLI Corpus")) using [Amazon Translate](https://aws.amazon.com/tr/translate/ "Amazon Translate NMT service").  The English sentences of the datasets can be accessed from the original corpus by using their common identifier key (pairID).

The characteristics of the datasets can be reviewed in [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14963) and the details of the NLI task can be reviewed in [the lectures videos of CS224U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_VPUF9ResU&list=PLoROMvodv4rObpMCir6rNNUlFAn56Js20&index=8 "Lectures ‚Äì NLI | Stanford CS224U: Natural Language Understanding | Spring 2019").  

## üìú SNLI-TR
The [SNLI-TR 1.0](#-download-nli-tr) and [SNLI-TR 1.1](#-download-nli-tr) (~44MB, zip)  are the Turkish translation (NMT) of the original [SNLI 1.0](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/snli_1.0.zip "The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus") (~100MB, zip).  The only difference between the version 1.0 and 1.1 is that the latter includes and additional key field (`translation_annotations`) containing the evaluations of translations for some of the examples.

An example from SNLI:
<pre>
{
        "annotator_labels": [
            "neutral"
        ],
        "captionID": "4688994030.jpg#3",
        "gold_label": "neutral",
        "pairID": "4688994030.jpg#3r1n",
        "sentence1": "A medical worker wearing a mask in the hospital.",
        "sentence1_binary_parse": "( ( ( A ( medical worker ) ) ( wearing ( ( a mask ) ( in ( the hospital ) ) ) ) ) . )",
        "sentence1_parse": "(ROOT (NP (NP (DT A) (JJ medical) (NN worker)) (VP (VBG wearing) (NP (NP (DT a) (NN mask)) (PP (IN in) (NP (DT the) (NN hospital))))) (. .)))",
        "sentence2": "A woman is in the hosptial working.",
        "sentence2_binary_parse": "( ( A woman ) ( ( is ( in ( the ( hosptial working ) ) ) ) . ) )",
        "sentence2_parse": "(ROOT (S (NP (DT A) (NN woman)) (VP (VBZ is) (PP (IN in) (NP (DT the) (JJ hosptial) (NN working)))) (. .)))",
        "promptID": 90816
}
</pre>

The corresponding Turkish translation in SNLI-TR:
<pre>

        "annotator_labels": [
            "neutral"
        ],

        "gold_label": "neutral",
        "pairID": "4688994030.jpg#3r1n",

## üìú MultiNLI-TR
The [MultiNLI-TR 1.0](#-download-nli-tr) and [MultiNLI-TR 1.1](#-download-nli-tr) (~72MB, zip) are the Turkish translation (NMT) of the original [MultiNLI 1.0](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/multinli/multinli_1.0.zip "The Multi-Genre NLI Corpus") corpus (~216MB, zip). The only difference between the version 1.0 and 1.1 is that the latter includes an additional key field (`translation_annotations`) containing the evaluations of translations for some of the examples.   

An example from MultiNLI:

<pre>

        "annotator_labels": [

## :heavy_check_mark: Annotations

We included the annotations for the annotated examples inside the `translation_annotations` key field as shown with an example from SNLI-TR.

<pre>
{
        "annotator_labels": [
            "entailment"
        ],
        "captionID": "6925887658.jpg#3",
        "gold_label": "entailment",
        "pairID": "6925887658.jpg#3r1e",
        "sentence1": "ƒ∞ki futbolcu topu almak i√ßin yarƒ±≈üƒ±yor.",
        "sentence2": "ƒ∞ki futbolcu bir futbol ma√ßƒ±nda oynuyor",
        "translation_annotations": {
            "annotator_ids": [
                1,2,5,8,10
            ],
            "annotator_labels": [
                "entailment","entailment","entailment","entailment","entailment"
            ],
            "translation_scores": [
                5,5,4,5,5
            ],
            "gold_label": "entailment"
        }
}
</pre>

The descriptions of the keys inside `translation_annotations` are listed below.
 
* `annotator_ids`: The numeric identifiers of the annotators who annotated this pair (and all other related pairs of its caption/prompt).
* `annotator_labels`: The NLI labels of the translated sentences including the label `"broken"` for the examples having major translation errors.
* `translation_scores`: The quality scores of the translations in a Lickert ordinal scale [1-5].
* `gold_label`: The majority-level label of the annotations which include the label `"broken"` for the pairs which have either major translation error or no majority-level label.

The corresponding pair in the SNLI dataset for comparison.

<pre>
{
   "annotator_labels":[
      "entailment"
   ],
   "captionID":"6925887658.jpg#3",
   "gold_label":"entailment",
   "pairID":"6925887658.jpg#3r1e",
   "sentence1":"Two soccer players are vying for the ball.",
   "sentence1_binary_parse":"( ( Two ( soccer players ) ) ( ( are ( vying ( for ( the ball ) ) ) ) . ) )",
   "sentence1_parse":"(ROOT (S (NP (CD Two) (NN soccer) (NNS players)) (VP (VBP are) (VP (VBG vying) (PP (IN for) (NP (DT the) (NN ball))))) (. .)))",
   "sentence2":"Two soccer players are playing in a soccer match",
   "sentence2_binary_parse":"( ( Two ( soccer players ) ) ( are ( playing ( in ( a ( soccer match ) ) ) ) ) )",
   "sentence2_parse":"(ROOT (S (NP (CD Two) (NN soccer) (NNS players)) (VP (VBP are) (VP (VBG playing) (PP (IN in) (NP (DT a) (NN soccer) (NN match)))))))"
